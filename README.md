# Klee - An open-source procedural AI engine

Visual procedural programming allows for very rapid, highly performant and iterative programming making it a great acrhitecture for machine learning and MLOPs. Node-based programming can be mixed with scripting.  

This style of programming has been proven in VFX and game engines like SideFX Houdini, Unity 3D, and Unreal Engine. Games like Fortnite are almost entirely built using visual programming.   

This software architecture allows data scientists, biologists, reseachers, Kagglers and anyone interested in developing custom AI applications to be far more effective than they would be writing lots of scripts and notebooks.
